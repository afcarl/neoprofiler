{"name":"Neoprofiler","tagline":"Neo4J database profiling utility","body":"## Synopsis\r\n\r\nThis package is a lightweight set of profiling utilities for Neo4J databases.\r\nThis is intended to quickly help users derive the rough structure and\r\npopulation of a new Neo4J database.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n**Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/moxious/neoprofiler.git`\r\n\r\n**Package the application**:  `mvn package`\r\n\r\n**Run from the command line**: \r\n`java -jar target/neoprofiler-0.1.one-jar.jar -db path_to_db -format html -output db_profile_report.html`\r\n\r\nThe argument given to the application should be the path to a directory containing a neo4j database.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: NeoProfiler\r\n -db <db>           Path to directory where neo4j database is located\r\n -format <format>   Output format: valid values are json, markdown, or\r\n                    html\r\n -output <output>   Name of output file to write; program will print to\r\n                    console if not specified.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIf you work with many Neo4J databases, it's often convenient to get a\r\nhigh-level picture of what is in a particular dataset before you jump in.  If\r\nyou write application code which interacts with a Neo4J database, it's good to\r\nbe able to verify that the population of nodes and relationships you're writing\r\nhave the properties that you expect.\r\n\r\n## Output Example\r\n\r\nThe program knows how to output JSON, Markdown, and HTML as output.   To see\r\na sample HTML report, download [sample-report.html](sample-report.html) and\r\nview it in a browser.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe program contains a number of profilers, most of which run very simple\r\nCypher queries against your database and provide summary statistics.  Some\r\nprofilers will actually discover data in your graph and then spawn other\r\nprofilers which will run later.  For example, if a label called \"Person\" is\r\ndiscovered in the data, a label profiler will be added to the run queue to \r\ninspect the population of nodes with that label.\r\n\r\nRight now, the focus is on simple queries that return descriptive statistics.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, profiling right now must occur while the database is offline,\r\nbecause the profiler opens the database in embedded mode.\r\n\r\n### Can I profile a database available via a URL?\r\n\r\nNo, not yet - but this is part of the plan, and is in the works.\r\n\r\n### Will the profiler modify my database?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not.  All queries are read-only; any storage that is needed will\r\nhappen in memory or via another method, to guarantee no modifications are\r\nmade to the database being profiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
